title: Augmented Reality system using Planar Homographies.
summary: Planar homography is a warp operation that maps pixel coordinates from one camera frame to another with the fundamental assumption that the points are lying on a plane in the real world. This concept allows us to create cool applications such as an augmented reality system or a panorama stitcher.

**MOTIVATION:**

Planar homography is a warp operation that maps pixel coordinates from one camera frame to another with the fundamental assumption that the points are lying on a plane in the real world. Under this assumption the mapping can be expressed as 
x1 â‰¡ Hx2
Where x1 and x2 are homogeneous coordinates and H is the homography matrix.
